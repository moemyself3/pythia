### Finding them now. Under heavy development.

## Considerations

#### Django's Development Server

As per Django [Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-runserver)
> DO NOT USE THIS SERVER IN A PRODUCTION SETTING. It has not gone through security audits or performance tests. (And thatâ€™s how itâ€™s gonna stay. Weâ€™re in the business of making web frameworks, not web servers, so improving this server to be able to handle a production environment is outside the scope of Django.)

#### Authentication

Based on the previous section you should consider safe network practices.
