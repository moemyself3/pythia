# Pythia ðŸ”®

Pythia is a client for an observatory database to see observation queues, alerts, and catalogs.
The client is a web-based UI using Django.

## Requirements
The database relies on PostgreSQL schemas!!
In your database you will need to setup the following schemas:

- public
- surveydb
- alerts

### Python and Django
This was written using Python 3.12 and Django 5.0.3.

## Installation
### Steps

1. make a virtual enviorment

We recommend you make a seperate virtual enviroment!

### Note for conda enviorments
If you use anaconda to make a conda enviorment and try to install django 
with conda you may be using an older version of django!

To use the latest version of django either use conda-forge channel or
use pip install django.

2. install Django
3. download or clone this repo
4. ``cd pythia/pythia``
5. copy ``.env.example`` and save as ``.env``
6. edit ``.env`` with your setup
    1. be sure to update parameters for your use case
7. run migrations for the database schemas seperately
    1. ``python manage.py migrate --database=django``
    2. ``python manage.py migrate --database=surveydb``
    3. ``python manage.py migrate --database=alerts``
8. optional step for admin account ``python manage.py createsuperuser``
9. ``python manage.py runserver``
10. open a browser window and visit the ip address django provides, the default is ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/``

## Considerations

#### Django's Development Server

As per Django [Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-runserver)
> DO NOT USE THIS SERVER IN A PRODUCTION SETTING. It has not gone through security audits or performance tests. (And thatâ€™s how itâ€™s gonna stay. Weâ€™re in the business of making web frameworks, not web servers, so improving this server to be able to handle a production environment is outside the scope of Django.)

[How to deploy Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/howto/deployment/)


#### Authentication

Based on the previous section you should consider safe network practices.
